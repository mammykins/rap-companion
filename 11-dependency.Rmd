# Dependency management {#dep}

> If you want your code to be reproducible in the long-run (i.e. so you can come back to run it next month or next year), you’ll need to track the versions of the packages that your code uses. A rigorous approach is to use packrat, http://rstudio.github.io/packrat/, which store packages in your project directory, or checkpoint, https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint, which will reinstall packages available on a specified date. A quick and dirty hack is to include a chunk that runs sessionInfo() — that won’t you let easily recreate your packages as they are today, but at least you’ll know what they were.

One of the problems with working with open source software is that it is quite easy to fall into a trap called ‘[dependency hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell)’. Essentially, this occurs when the software we write depends on open source packages, which depend on other open source packages, which can depend on other packages, and on, and on.

All these packages may be written by many different people, and are updated at vastly different timescales. If we fail to take account of this, then we are likely to fail at the first hurdle of reproducibility, and we may find that in a year’s time we are no longer able to reproduce the work that we previously did - or at least not without a lot of trouble. There are several ways we might get on top of this problem, but in this project we opted for using [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/), which creates a cache of all the R packages used in the project which is then version controlled on GitHub. Matt Upson has [blogged about this previously](http://www.machinegurning.com/rstats/latex-phd/) in the context of writing academic works.
