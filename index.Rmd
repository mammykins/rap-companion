Producing official statistics for publications is a key function of many teams across Government. It’s a time consuming and meticulous process to ensure that statistics are accurate and timely. With open source software becoming more widely used, there’s now a [range of tools](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/choosing-technology-an-introduction) and techniques that can be used to reduce production time, whilst maintaining and even improving the quality of the publications. This book is about these techniques: what they are, and how we can use them.  

## Discovery

> Something is better than nothing. 

This is NOT TRUE in the [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) world; consider the opportunity cost^[the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen].  

Prior to commiting to RAP development in your team ask yourself two questions:  

1. Is there a genuine user need for this new product/service?
2. Does another product/service exist that you can re-use or adapt?^[There's probably some code you can adapt on Github, such as the [eesectors pacakge](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/eesectors)]

## Inspiration

This book was inspired by and draws heavily from a Government Digital Service [blog post](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) by Dr. Matthew Upson.
