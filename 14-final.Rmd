# Final Thoughts {#final}

It's called Data Science for a reason, record all the data handling, experimentation and analysis in your [lab-notebook](http://colinpurrington.com/tips/lab-notebooks).

Version control is your digital lab notebook.

## User feedback

The RAP companion is intended to point data scientists in the Civil Service towards the Data Ops toolkit that should be used when attempting to automate some of the boring stuff for their colleagues. Your feedback is welcome and important. It will help us improve the RAP companion through further iterations.  

You can feedback through completing this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeVYmjJIPm-YJ_lgKu0JdIiUwc2glSLtfGFQxKdW1cMmRwbCQ/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1747016377=4&entry.305553560=4&entry.349499540&entry.1168732002=Column+4&entry.1948461863=Column+4&entry.1262699325=Column+4&entry.1033407422=Column+4&entry.900063493=Column+4&entry.811492760=Column+4&entry.2083454847&entry.2141214542=Yes&entry.1340586078&entry.879050699&entry.1223500353) which allows us to [measure your satisfaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction).  

Or, by raising an [issue on the RAP companion repo page](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/rap_companion/issues).  

## Just the beginning...

We've introduced you to the basics of reproducibility and Data Ops. For further development ideas and inspiration consider the [Data Ops manifesto](http://dataopsmanifesto.org/).
