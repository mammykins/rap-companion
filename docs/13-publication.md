# Producing the publication {#pub}

> R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more. 
- Hadley Wikcham, R for Data Science

You can write individual chapters using [R markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html), as one file per Chapter.  

Alternatively you can write the whole publication using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/). For a basic start in bookdown try this [blog post](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html) (we wrote this book using this to kick things off).
