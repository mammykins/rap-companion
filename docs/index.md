Producing official statistics for publications is a key function of many teams across Government. It’s a time consuming and meticulous process to ensure that statistics are accurate and timely. With open source software becoming more widely used, there’s now a [range of tools](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/choosing-technology-an-introduction) and techniques that can be used to reduce production time, whilst maintaining and even improving the quality of the publications. This book is about these techniques: what they are, and how we can use them.  

This book was inspired by and draws heavily from a Government Digital Service [blog post](https://gdsdata.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/) by Dr. Matthew Upson in the Better Use of Data team.
